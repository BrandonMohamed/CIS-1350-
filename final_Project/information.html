      <h1>Information about Trinidad&Tobago</h1>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>First colonized by the Spanish, the islands came under British control in the early 19th century. 
        The islands' sugar industry was hurt by the emancipation of the slaves in 1834. Manpower was replaced
        with the importation of contract laborers from India between 1845 and 1917, which boosted sugar production
        as well as the cocoa industry. The discovery of oil on Trinidad in 1910 added another important export. 
        Independence was attained in 1962. The country is one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean thanks largely
        to petroleum and natural gas production and processing. Tourism, mostly in Tobago, is targeted for expansion 
        and is growing.Location of Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean, islands between the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic

      <h2>Beachs</h2>
      <p>Pigeon Point with its famous thatched-roof jetty leading directly into the sea has been named one of the most beautiful beaches in the 
      Caribbean by various international travel publications. Officially named the Pigeon Point Heritage Park, the facility includes souvenir shops,
      a restaurant and bar, a water sports shop, and restroom and changing room facilities. Among the activities visitors can enjoy are swimming, 
      snorkelling, (kite)surfing, diving, kayaking and water skiing.Probably the most popular beach in Trinidad is Maracas Bay on the north coast, 
      a winding 30-minute drive along the mountainside from the capital city, Port of Spain. Visitors enjoy the panoramic vistas of the palm-fringed 
      beach with its energetic waves. No visit to Maracas Bay is complete without a trip to the vendor booths for bake and fish sandwiches - fried bread 
      filled with seasoned fried-fish fillets, vegetables, fruit and an assortment of condiments ranging from sweet to very spicy.

      <p>Las Cuevas Bay got its name because of the many caves you can find along the stretch of beach. Trinidad’s first Blue Flag beach, Las Cuevas beckons with its
      clear waters and gently lapping waves.Macqueripe, on the north-western peninsula of Chaguaramas, has a beautifully landscaped beach. From here, 
      adventure lovers can also access a 7-course zip line adventure through the rainforest with splendid views of the Caribbean Sea.Mayaro Beach, on the 
      south-east coast, is the longest beach in Trinidad and a popular tourist destination for visitors who enjoy long walks on the beach and picnics on the sand. 
      The strong Atlantic undercurrents and high waves make swimming here suitable only for very experienced ocean swimmers.It is at Columbus Bay on Trinidad’s 
      southwestern coast that Christopher Columbus first made landfall in Trinidad in 1498. From the seemingly endless golden-sand shore at low tide on a clear day, 
      you can see the outline of Venezuela, located just 7 miles away. </p>
