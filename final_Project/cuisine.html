      <p>Doubles are a staple in the island nation of Trinidad and Tobago.
         Doubles is a common street food originating from Trinidad and Tobago. 
         It is normally eaten during breakfast, but is also eaten occasionally 
         during lunch or as a late night snack and popular hangover food for local
         Trinidadians.Doubles are made with two baras (flat fried dough) and 
         filled with curry channa (curried chickpeas) and various chutneys.Hearty 
         chickpea curry, called channa, scented with garlic and onion, curry powder
         and cumin fills out the sandwich. Pepper sauce, mango pickle, and tamarind 
         are the condiments of choice. Ideally youâ€™d use them all at once; a balance 
         of heat, sour, and sweet.</p>

         Trinidad and Tobago has a large varity of fruits because of the vast tropical climate. Most fruits
         are widely eaten and used for making other dishes. My personal favorite is chennette. This tiny 
         fruit grows in bunches and is covered by a green, rough but thin skin. Inside the fruit is a large
          seed covered by a sweet or sometimes tart pulp.
